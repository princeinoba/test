      <p>
        Local businesses were hit hard by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Help support
        them with Eat Local, a lookup for restaurants within 10km of your
        current location. You can search for restaurants with the provided
        categories or type in whatever you're craving.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-0">
        Eat Local provides you with helpful restaurant information so you can
        confidently make your pick:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Distance from you</li>
        <li>Star ratings from Yelp</li>
        <li>Opening and Closing times (where available)</li>
        <li>Additional restaurant information (where available)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Eat Local relies on two APIs to gather information: Yelp API and Zomato
        API. While the main information comes from Yelp, Zomato adds supporting
        information that may or may not appear depending on the restaurant.
