      <p>Use this weather dashboard to help you plan for your travels.</p>
      <p className="mb-0">The current weather panel will tell you today's:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature</li>
        <li>Humidity</li>
        <li>Wind Speed</li>
        <li>UV Index</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While the 5-Day Forecast focuses on the temperature and humidity of the
        day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dashboard also displays a history of your searches for ease of
        access. When you leave the site and come back, weather data on your last
        searched city automatically populates the dashboard.
      </p>
      <p>The weather dashboard saves data using Local Storage.</p>
