      <p>
        If you're learning JavaScript or just want to test your knowledge, this
        quiz can be a helpful review. The quiz is made up of 5 questions with 60
        seconds on the clock. If you get a question wrong, 10 seconds is
        deducted from the timer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your final score is the amount of time left after you answer all 5
        questions or a score of 0 if your time runs out before then. Once
        complete, you can save your score with your initials and compare against
        your friends.
      </p>
      <p>Scores are saved using Local Storage.</p>
