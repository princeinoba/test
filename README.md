# My Portfolio Site



:link: [Portfolio Website](https://inoba-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)

View my most recent projects, get to know me a little more and feel free to reach out. If you're interested, you can also grab a copy of my resume.

This portfolio was an ongoing effort throughout Bootcamp. It started with hard-coded HTML pages and has now turned into a React application.

## Purpose

My journey as a web developer has come a long way from `var` and

```
if (foo === true) {
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}
```

My portfolio is a place to document that growth (and my current blunders). Feel free to contact me on any improvements I can make. I am always open for feedback. :smile:
